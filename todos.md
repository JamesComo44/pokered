## Bugs
- [x] Graphics Rendering incorrectly
- [x] Not showing up in Pokedex
  - Fixed in `debug_party.asm` at `DebugSetPokedexEntries`. When we added mew, this wasn't updated, because Mew was removed from Pokedex.
- [ ] Debug battle not registering moves (all are Pound??)
- [ ] Make sure cry matches what was expected

## Implementation
- [ ] Spawn area (forest?)
- [ ] Add to battle trainers
