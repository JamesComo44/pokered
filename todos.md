# Bugs
- [x] Graphics Rendering incorrectly
- [x] Not showing up in Pokedex
  - Fixed in `debug_party.asm` at `DebugSetPokedexEntries`. When we added mew, this wasn't updated, because Mew was removed from Pokedex.
- [x] Debug battle not registering moves (all are Pound??)
- [x] Make sure cry matches what was expected
- [x] Rival picks up pokeball in Oak's Lab
